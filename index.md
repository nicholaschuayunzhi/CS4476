# _Cave Street View_
---

## Problem Statement
Simply put, our project is to make Google Street View for caves. We are going to take a set of cave images and then warp, combine, filter, and blend them into a pleasing spherical viewport such that a user can look around in  a similar fashion as they would through Google Street View.

<pic src="images/image0.jpg" width="300" alt="Logo"></pic>
<pic src="images/image1.jpg" width="300" alt="Logo"></pic>
<pic src="images/image2.jpg" width="300" alt="Logo"></pic>


An important focus of the project is to filter images in a way that removes inherent flaws that stem from taking pictures in caves. Caves are dark and damp, two conditions that can limit good photography. Having proper lighting can be difficult and so any algorithm that combines pictures will need to be able differentiate lighting conditions and pick the one that is most appropriate. The moisture in cave also causes problems as the moisture may reflect light which can cause odd distortions and visual flaws.

Our project will be to construct an algorithm that can remove these potential environmental photo flaws and produce a spherical viewport from which the magnificence of caves can be safely enjoyed digitally.
